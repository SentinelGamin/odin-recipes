    <h3>Brenda's Lasagna</h3>
    <p>It was very good and is great for leftovers too. I did make a 
        key change: I used a homemade sauce instead of a jarred sauce. 
        The homemade sauce already had onion and garlic so I left 
        those out of the main recipe.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef and season with salt and pepper; drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of noodles, meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
